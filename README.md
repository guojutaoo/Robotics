# Four-legged crawling robot

### This is the educative version(sample code, incomplete) of the robot's source code, the code belongs to ShanXi Wanli technology Co. Ltd, my boss Lihong Li is also the professor and the advisor of the robotics lab in Taiyuan Uiversity of Technology, so this simple version of source code is authorized to share for educative purpose.

### This is the source code of the slave machine of a four-legged crawling robot. The robot is the 2nd generation of the wall-cleaning robot with a clean arm implemented on top of the robot. Each of the robot's leg consists of 3 electric putters and 1 servomotor, which is flexible enough to allow the robot performing difficult gestures.

### The four-legged crawling robot embedded system program using C with software Keil5, which inputs and analyzes data from a master machine and implements the robot’s gestures (including straight-walk, turn-around, and push-up) by solving the robot’s legs’ kinematical equation.

### Used MODBUS and created a 22-bit protocol designed to accomplish master-slave communications using C#. The communications software can remotely control the robot to switch to different gestures and move to designated physical locations.
